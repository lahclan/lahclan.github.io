## Introduction

This is where your content starts. Since you are using Jekyll, you can use standard **Markdown** formatting.

### Subheading Example

You can add lists, links, and text formatting easily:

* Item one
* Item two
* [Link to Google](https://google.com)

## Math and Code

Since you are studying Physics and CS, you will likely use these features often.

### Code Blocks
To display code (like Python or C++), use triple backticks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Physics!")
