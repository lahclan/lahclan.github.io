Above is a chart of a bunch of different movies, albums, and books that I really like. I will definitely update this at some point but not sure when. Besides media, some of my  favorite foods include: tofu, Georgian khinkali, eggs, egg sandwiches, Cheerios with warm milk, bulgogi with rice, and my mom's ham hock bean soup. Additionally, some of my favorite beverages include: mango Goodbelly, coconut water (Vita Coco), oolong tea, chamomile tea (dancong), Mineragua, Topo Chico, LaCroix (pamplemousse), Bubly (grapefruit), and Spindrift (grapefruit).
